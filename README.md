I have been working to migrate Angular components to React after researching different approaches such as wrapping Angular and using Web components.

For this Project 
1. I have clined Angular app
2. I created Brand new React project and component plus encapsulated it within a Web component.
3. Integrated Web component into Angular application.
4. Ensured smooth communication b/n React and Angular
5. Tested Rendering and intraction within Angular app
